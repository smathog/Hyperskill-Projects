# About

Cinema has been a part of the entertainment industry for a long time: a good movie is a way to escape reality and live through a variety of emotions. The best cinema experience you can get is probably in a cinema theatre. In this project, you will create an application that helps manage a cinema theatre: sell tickets, check available seats, see sales statistics, and more.

# Learning outcomes
This project is a good opportunity to work with input and output in Java. You will deal with multi-dimensional arrays and functions as well as loops and conditional statements.

# Impressions

Overall, this project was similar to the other easy difficulty projects. I do feel that the earlier stages sort of made it difficult to justify an early separation of the project requirements into a separate class, but the later stages made doing so beneficial. Additionally, it was important to consistently map between the 1-based indexing system of the problem and the 0-based indexing of Java's storage structures.
