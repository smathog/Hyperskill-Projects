# About

Writing games is probably one of the most exciting tasks in programming. Develop your own version of the popular "Battleship Game" to play with your friends!

# Learning outcomes

You will understand the process of developing such a complex program as a game and learn about processing user input and handling errors.

# Notes

Overall, this was an enjoyable and fairly straightforwards project. Some of the study topics didn't seem terribly related (particularly in Stage 4; reflection is useful, but I personally don't see how a typical design for this game would lead one towards this as a possible part of the implementation), and the previous stages didn't necessarily make it obvious to implement things in a manner conducive for the final stages, but beyond this the project was useful practice of quite a few basic Java concepts; in particular I found that it helped reinforce the use of Java enums relative to, say, C++ enums.
