# Description

Battleship (also called Battleships or Sea Battle) is a two-player strategy game whose history traces back to the First World War. It started off as a pencil and paper game, until Milton Bradley coined the rules and published the game. Fun fact: it was one of the first games to be produced as a computer game in 1979! In this project, we will recreate this timeless classic.

First off, brush up on the rules of the game. There are different variations of the Battleship game, but we will stick to the original rules written by Milton Bradley. You have a 10Ã—10 game field and five ships to arrange on that field. The ships can be placed horizontally or vertically but not diagonally across the grid spaces; the ships should not cross or touch each other. The goal is to sink all the ships of the opponent before your opponent does this to you.

Positioning the ships is exactly where we are going to start! The goal of this first stage is to place all the ships on the game field according to the rules.

# Objectives

In this stage, you should arrange your ships on the game field. Before you start, let's discuss the conventions of the game:

1. On a 10x10 field, the first row should contain numbers from 1 to 10 indicating the column, and the first column should contain letters from A to J indicating the row.
2. The symbol ~ denotes the fog of war: the unknown area on the opponent's field and the yet untouched area on your field.
3. The symbol O denotes a cell with your ship, X denotes that the ship was hit, and M signifies a miss.
4. You have 5 ships: Aircraft Carrier is 5 cells, Battleship is 4 cells, Submarine is 3 cells, Cruiser is also 3 cells, and Destroyer is 2 cells. Start placing your ships with the largest one.
5. To place a ship, enter two coordinates: the beginning and the end of the ship.
6. If an error occurs in the input coordinates, your program should report it. The message should contain the word Error.

# Notes

To implement this stage, I chose to use a separate Board class with its own built in functionality in order to handle the various actions required; this should presumably make future extensions simpler than if I had hardcoded everything into the main class instead. The most difficult part of the stage had to do with the requisite error checking when adding ships; I encountered several "off-by-1" style errors due to issues with shifting between the input coordinate system and the o-based indexing of the internal array for the Board class, which is probably further proof of the benefits of Test-Driven Development.
