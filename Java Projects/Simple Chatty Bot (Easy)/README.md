# Project: Simple Chatty Bot

The general project description for this project can be found [here](https://hyperskill.org/projects/31?goal=7)

## Thoughts:

This project was a pretty good way of being introduced to some of the basic syntax and control structures for 
Java. It was overall pretty simplistic, but that's not a bad thing when trying to pick up a new language, 
especially when considering this may be the first project for somebody learning a programming language for the
first time altogether. For me personally, it was a good way to start seeing some of the basic differences from 
C++, despite the outwards appearance in basic syntax.
