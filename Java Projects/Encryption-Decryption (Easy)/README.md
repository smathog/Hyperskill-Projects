## Thoughts: 

I liked this project quite a bit, mostly because the learning and exercise units involved 
really helped hammer down some of the first really clear distinctions between my knowledge
of C++ and Java (outside of the obvious initial things like Java's reference types vs. 
C++'s value + reference semantics or the copious usage of 'new' in Java relative to C++. While
a lot of this knowledge wasn't necessary to complete this project itself, it's still handy. A
good example would be how Java permits virtual behavior in constructors themselves; coming 
from a C++ background, this was somewhat surprising but makes sense with Java's greater OO 
focus.
