# About

Write your own advanced version of the classic code breaking game "Bulls and Cows". Start with recreating the original version of the game and then take it to a new level.

# Learning outcomes

Learn how to use integer arithmetic, generate random numbers, store data in data structures, and handle errors.

# Impressions

Overall, this was fairly similar to the other easy projects: a good introduction to various standard language features of Java. I was using it mostly as review after taking a break from Java, and it served this purpose well.
