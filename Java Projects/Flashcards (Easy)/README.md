# Project: Flashcards

The specification for the project can be found [here](https://hyperskill.org/projects/44?goal=7)

## Thoughts:

This project as a whole was pretty good and straightforwards, although Stage 6 had somewhat
vague and confusing instructions. Overall, it provided a good workthrough of the basic 
usage of the various Java collections and maps, as well as various helper functions/objects
associated with them. A good capstone to Hyperskill's "Easy" Java projects!
