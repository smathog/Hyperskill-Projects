## Thoughts

This final stage was for the most part straightforwards. The only main problems I 
encountered were some difficulties regarding finding a good Regex expression to properly
count all the syllables, and some issues with the judging/grading system not liking the
hyphens in some output statements. I also feel the specification was kind of vague on 
certain points (for example, the final output statement seems not to have been judged
on correctness; some test code without it implemented was deemed correct!), but this didn't
prove to be too much of an issue.
