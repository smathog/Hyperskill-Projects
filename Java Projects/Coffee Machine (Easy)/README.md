# Project: Coffee Machine

The general project specification can be found [here](https://hyperskill.org/projects/33?goal=7)

## Thoughts:

Another fairly good exercise in getting more knowledgeable about the general syntax of Java as well
as how classes and objects behave to a degree. In terms of design, I probably should have moved the 
CoffeeMachine class into a separate class from main and made it mostly or all non-static, since clearly
we should be able to create difference instances of coffee machines; and of course, there's also a need
to handle possible bad input (negative addition of water, for example), but that comes in later projects.
