# Project: Numeral System Converter

The project specification can be found [here](https://hyperskill.org/projects/41?goal=7)

## Thoughts:

As with most of these projects, the main difficulty stems from the instructions not always
being 100% clear; but between the provided test case error messages and the comments/hints
section, it isn't usually too hard to figure out. 

Overall, this project wasn't particularly difficult and mostly revolved around knowledge
of certain library/builtin features.
