## Hyperskill Projects

Not much to say here; the repo name is pretty self-explanatory. This repo contains my solutions/implementations for the various projects I have completed for the Hyperskill educational platform, which can be found [here](https://hyperskill.org/tracks). As of the time of writing this readme, I have completed all non-beta Java projects and the track as a whole, and am now pushing forward through the Python track as well.
